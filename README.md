# Traffic Control System

## Overview

The Traffic Control System is an Arduino-based application designed to efficiently manage traffic lights at intersections. The system incorporates round-robin traffic control, emergency vehicle prioritization, and train detection functionalities. It ensures a smooth flow of traffic while prioritizing safety and quick response for emergency vehicles and trains. This project serves as a solid foundation for developing more advanced traffic management systems.

## Features

- **Round Robin Traffic Control**: Automatically manages four sets of traffic lights, cycling through them in a round-robin manner for efficient traffic flow.
- **Emergency Traffic Control**: Detects emergency vehicles using RFID tags, turning all traffic lights red and granting priority to the emergency vehicle.
- **Train Detection Traffic Control**: Utilizes an IR sensor to detect approaching trains, turning all traffic lights red to ensure safety at intersections.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/Ahsan-Habib147/traffic-control-system.git

2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.

3. Connect the hardware components according to the pin configuration provided in the code.

4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the system to start the traffic control functionalities.
2. The system will automatically manage traffic lights based on the implemented logic.
3. Emergency vehicle detection and train detection features will operate without user intervention.
